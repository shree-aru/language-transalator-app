# Language Translator App

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Problem Statement
In our increasingly connected world, communication across different languages is essential. However, real-time, accurate translation remains a challenge for many users, especially when they lack access to premium online services or need a lightweight, offline solution. Traditional machine translation often relies on heavy cloud infrastructure or word-level translation, which can miss contextual nuances in short, informal sentences.

### 1.2 Project Objective
This project aims to develop a desktop-based, GUI-enabled English-to-French Language Translator App using Python. Leveraging character-level sequence-to-sequence learning via LSTM neural networks, the tool provides users with simple, efficient, and offline translation capabilities. The application is built with a user-friendly interface using Tkinter and is intended for educational, demonstrative, and lightweight practical use.

### 1.3 Expected Outcome
The final product is an interactive desktop application that accepts English input and returns French translations. It includes a trained model, a character-level encoding mechanism, and real-time decoding. The project comes with full source code, training logic, data preparation, and GUI integration, along with documentation for academic, GitHub, or portfolio use.

## 2. Features

### 2.1 Offline English-to-French Translation
The app works offline and uses a pre-trained LSTM-based sequence-to-sequence model to generate accurate French sentences from English input.

### 2.2 Character-level Neural Translation
Unlike word-based models, this implementation handles each sentence at the character level. This increases flexibility and helps in learning sentence structure, punctuation, and short inputs.

### 2.3 Real-Time GUI Interaction
The Tkinter-based GUI provides:
- A simple text input for English sentences.
- A live response in French.
- Scrollable text output for longer translations.

### 2.4 Model Trained on 10,000+ Sentence Pairs
The app uses a subset of the **eng-french.txt** dataset consisting of over 10,000 English‚ÄìFrench sentence pairs for training.

### 2.5 Modular Architecture
- `langTraining.py`: Handles training and model creation.
- `LangTransGui.py`: Manages the user interface and inference logic.
- `training_data.pkl`: Pickled dictionary of metadata (character sets, max lengths).
- `s2s_model.h5`: Saved trained Keras model.
